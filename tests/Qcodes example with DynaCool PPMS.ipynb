    "# QCoDeS Example with DynaCool PPMS\n",

    "This notebook explains how to control the DynaCool PPMS from QCoDeS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this setup to work, the proprietary `PPMS Dynacool` application (or, alternatively `Simulate PPMS Dynacool`) must be running on some PC. On that same PC, the `server.py` script (found in `qcodes/instrument_drivers/QuantumDesign/DynaCoolPPMS/private`) must be running. The script can be run from the command line with no arguments and will run under python 3.6+.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The QCoDeS driver sends strings via VISA to the server who passes those same strings on to the `CommandHandler` (found in `qcodes/instrument_drivers/QuantumDesign/DynaCoolPPMS/commandhandler`). The `CommandHandler` makes the calls into the proprietary API. The QCoDeS driver can thus be called on any machine that can communicate with the machine hosting the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from that, the driver is really simple. For this notebook, we used the `Simulate PPMS Dynacool` application running on the same machine as QCoDeS."
