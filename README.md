# Levylab QCoDeS
> QCoDeS Implementation for Levylab.

[QCoDeS](https://github.com/microsoft/Qcodes) is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed for quantum physics experiments, but it can be adapted for a wide range of scientific experiments.  
This project aims to adapt QCoDeS as an Experiment Framework at Levylab by integrating it with the existing [Instrument Framework](https://github.com/levylabpitt/Instrument-Framework).
